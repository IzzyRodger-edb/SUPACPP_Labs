Code by Izzy Rodger, for assessment in the module "C++/ Object-Oriented Programming". 
The assignment consists of three files:
- CustomFunctions.cxx : containing all of the functions necessary to take the magnitude of a datapoint, 
perform a least-squares fit to a straight line, and raise x^int(y).
- CustomFunction.h : a header file, allowing for the use of these functions in...
- AnalyseData.cxx : this is the main file which allows the user to interface with the program.

The program must be compiled using:
g++ AnalyseData AnalyseData.cxx CustomFunctions.cxx

and subsequently run using:
./AnalyseData
which will print the following to the terminal:
Please select a function:
1) Print N lines of data
2) Calculate the magnitude of all datapoints
3) Least-squares fitting to a data file
4) Calculate x^y for all datapoints
5) Exit the program


To ensure correct functionality, the files input2D_float.txt and error2D_float.txt must be in the same directory as this program.
If they are not present but are called during operation, an error message will be produced that encourages you to verify this.

Thank you for the engaging assignment, and should you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me at
